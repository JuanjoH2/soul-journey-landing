# Project Overview: Soul Journey Landing Page

This project is to create a landing page for the "Soul Journey" app MVP. The primary goal of the landing page is to validate the app idea by collecting emails from interested users.

## About Soul Journey

Soul Journey is a gamified mobile application designed to help young people (ages 16-26) define and achieve their life's purpose. The app turns the process of finding one's "North Star" and building aligned habits into a fun, game-like experience.

### Core Concepts:

*   **Purpose-Centered:** Unlike other habit trackers, Soul Journey is built around helping users first define their purpose (their "Polaris" or "North Star").
*   **Gamification:** The app uses a narrative structure with characters (Hemi, Viator), quests, and rewards to make self-improvement feel like an epic adventure.
*   **Habit Tracking:** Once the purpose is defined, the app helps users create and track SMART goals and habits that are aligned with their larger goals.

### MVP Features:

1.  **Purpose Definition:** A guided process to help users find their "Ikigai" and "Memento Mori".
2.  **SMART Goal Tracking:** Define and track habits.
3.  **Social Challenges:** Challenge friends.
